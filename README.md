# Personal Information  
Hello, my name is Rahul Singh, and I'm an enthusiastic undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science. I began my journey in software development last year and have since developed a passion for exploring new technologies and innovations in the field. I enjoy diving into diverse aspects of computer science, from programming to theoretical foundations, and I'm always eager to learn and grow in this dynamic field.

# Interest in @kubebuilder 
While I was learning new things I got interested in Cloud computing and while searching I stumbled upon opportunities in CNCF so I started lookingfor internship at CNCF , then I got to know that there are two ways to get an internship at CNCF one through LFX and other through GSOC so I will try my best to contirbute to the project while learning new things.

# Motivation Factor 
As I mentioned earlier I always wanted to learn about Cloud related as we are seeing that it is being used constantly in our daily work and also I liked the Idea of 3-way-merge this excites me to work on this project specifically.

# Problem approaching strategy
I think keeping mind clear is necessary before approaching any problem . When we make big assumptions about the problems we might face we our blocking our vision to in the long run so I just think that it is good to figure things out on the go.

# Expectations from the Mentors 
I just expect that mentors guide me as I have no major experience in such big projects I have worked on my own starup and personal projects . But I have never contributed to any org like Kubernetes itself . So I just want to learn from the mentors and make some good contributions to the org.
